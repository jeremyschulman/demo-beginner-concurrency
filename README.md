# Demo Repository for PyCharm Webcast

This repository contains the code used for the 2022-Feb-22 PyCharm Webcast
_Beginner Concurrency with Python asyncio_.

# Installation

You will need to git-clone and install the project files directly as the repo
is not deployed on PyPi.  The project uses `poetry`, so you will need to create
a Python3.8 virtualenv with poetry.  Once created, you can install the files:

```shell
poetry install
```

You should then have a script called `demo` available in your virtualenv.  You can
verify via:

```shell
demo --help
```
